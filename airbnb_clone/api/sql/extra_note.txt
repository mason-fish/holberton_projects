To setup the database, a few additional steps were necessary:
   1. Port 3306 needed to be opened on the server's iptables (firewall)

   2. Additionally, within the mysql config file (/etc/mysql/my.cnf),
      the 'bind-address' needed to be changed from localhost (127.0.0.1)
      to the public facing ip of the server. This is important so that
      remote access can be made available after creating users and granting
      the appropriate permissions.
