What should you create? Using what?
     To gain secure access to a server with SSH key-based authentication, you must
     first generate a public & private key pair. This can be done using the ssh-keygen
     utility (included with OpenSSH suite, which you will need to install if it is not
     already on your machine).

What should you do with the public key? How will it be used? What will it do?
     The newly generated public key should be added to the desired server's authorized_keys
     directory. This key will be used to authenticate your client machine. This authentication
     begins by the client (e.g. your remote machine) initiating an SSH connection to the server,
     the server will respond by sending a random challenge message, the client will then encrypt
     this message using a private key and send it back to the server, finally the server will
     decrypt this using the public key (which is the pair of the private that was used to encrypt
     the message). If the message matches then the client is authenticated.

What should you do with the private key? How will it be used? What will it do?
     Private keys should always be kept as private as possible (do not share or copy it at all).
     They are used to encrypt data which can only be decrypted by their matching public keys. They
     are used for the authentication protocol described above.
